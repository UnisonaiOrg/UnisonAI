          According to step 1 of the plan, I need to initiate market research. The Researcher agent
          is specifically assigned this task and has the expertise needed. I will delegate with
          clear objectives: gather data on AI market trends, adoption rates, and competitive landscape.
          Expected deliverable: comprehensive market analysis report within 2 hours.
        name: send_message

          {{"agent_name": "Researcher",
            "message": "Execute step 1 of plan: Conduct comprehensive market research on AI adoption trends 2024. Focus on: 1) Enterprise adoption rates, 2) Key market players, 3) Growth projections, 4) Technical barriers. Provide structured report with sources and data points.",

          The task mentions 'detailed analysis' but doesn't specify the required depth or format.
          I need to clarify expectations before proceeding with delegation to ensure the team
          delivers exactly what the user needs. This prevents rework and ensures satisfaction.
        name: ask_user
        params: >
          {{"question": "For the detailed analysis requested, please specify: 1) Required depth (high-level overview vs deep-dive), 2) Preferred format (report, presentation, dashboard), 3) Target audience, 4) Deadline requirements."}}

          All team members have completed their assigned tasks. I have received: market research
          from Researcher, data analysis from Analyst, and visualizations from Designer. 
          I have reviewed all outputs for quality and completeness. The integrated deliverable
          meets all task requirements. Ready for final submission to user.

          {{"result": "COMPREHENSIVE AI MARKET ANALYSIS COMPLETE\n\n1. MARKET RESEARCH: 73% enterprise adoption rate, $156B market size projected 2024\n2. DATA ANALYSIS: 45% YoY growth in AI implementation, ROI average 23%\n3. VISUALIZATIONS: 12 charts showing trends, adoption patterns, and forecasts\n\nAll deliverables compiled in attached comprehensive report with executive summary, detailed findings, and actionable recommendations."}}

          Analyst has submitted data analysis results, but I need to verify completeness before
          proceeding to next step. The report seems to be missing the competitive analysis section
          mentioned in the plan. I will request the missing component to ensure quality standards.
        name: send_message
        params: >
          {{"agent_name": "Analyst",
            "message": "Received your data analysis report. Excellent work on market trends and adoption rates. However, step 2 of our plan also requires competitive analysis comparing top 5 AI vendors. Please provide this missing section to complete your deliverable.",
