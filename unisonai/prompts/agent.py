          According to step 2 of the plan, I need to analyze the data that was gathered in step 1. 
          The plan specifically assigns this to the Data_Analyst role, which matches my identity.
          I have the dataset from the previous step. I will delegate analysis with clear instructions
          and specific deliverables as outlined in the plan.
        name: send_message
        params: >
          {{"agent_name": "Data_Analyst",
            "message": "Execute step 2 of plan: Analyze user_engagement_data.csv for key metrics including retention rate, active users, and conversion patterns. Provide quantitative summary with specific numbers.",

          I have completed my assigned portion (step 3) of the plan - data visualization creation.
          The plan specifies that results should be reported to the Manager for final compilation.
          I will send the visualization results with specific outcomes achieved.
        name: send_message
        params: >
          {{"agent_name": "Manager",
            "message": "Step 3 complete. Created 4 data visualizations: retention trends chart, user segment analysis, conversion funnel diagram, and monthly active user growth. All charts saved to /outputs/ directory. Ready for step 4 integration.",

          Step 1 of the plan assigns me to gather market research data. I need to use the web_search 
          tool to find recent information about the target market as specified in the plan.
          This directly supports the overall task goal.
