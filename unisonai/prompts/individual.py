          The user has requested a "comprehensive report" but hasn't specified the scope, format,
          or target audience. To deliver exactly what they need, I must gather these details first.
          This prevents assumptions and ensures the final deliverable meets their expectations.

          The user wants information about current AI trends. I need to gather recent, factual data
