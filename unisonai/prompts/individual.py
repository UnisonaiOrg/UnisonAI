          The user has requested a "comprehensive report" but hasn't specified the scope, format,
          or target audience. To deliver exactly what they need, I must gather these details first.
          This prevents assumptions and ensures the final deliverable meets their expectations.

          The user wants information about current AI trends. I need to gather recent, factual data
          to provide accurate insights. Web search will give me the most current information available.
          I'll search for specific, quantifiable trends rather than general opinions.

          I've gathered valuable market research data that might be useful for future queries.
          I should store this information in memory for quick retrieval and reference.
